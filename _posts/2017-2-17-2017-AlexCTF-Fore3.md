title: Alex CTF USB Probing 3 – (150) 
---

This write-up is written after reviewing solutions written by other teams. The solutions of these other teams were too short for me to follow in one step. Therefore I would like to write a more extensive write-up of this challenge.

# Problem
The challenge consisted of a pcap file of data traffic between the pc and a USB drive.

The contents of the pcap file:

# (Unsuccessful) Attempts to solve the problem
* Simply try to export the objects \[File ==> Export Objects ==> \]
* After some googling I found a project that could replay the usb traffic to a real USB. I couldn’t get it to work during the CTF. The project sounds really cool and I want to invest some time in the future in order to see if I get this working on my own machine. (https://github.com/wcooley/usbrevue/blob/master/usbreplay.py)

# Solution
The pcap file showed 10 files being transferred to the USB drive.

I marked all the URB\_BULK out packets \[Edit → Mark/Unmark Packet\] and exported these marked packets \[File → Export Specified Packets …\] to the file bulk_out.pcap.

Wireshark didn’t help me by greying out the option to export packet bytes. This is obviously the easiest way to get a file, but I had to write a small script (running on a Mac)
```
 counter=1; for data in $(tshark -r ./bulk\_out.pcap -T fields -e usb.capdata -Y usb.capdata); do echo "$data" | xxd -r -ps > "file$counter.raw"; ((counter++)); done  
```
with the command `file file1.raw` you can try to let the file system determine the file type. In this case `file8.raw` gave the following output: `file8.raw: PNG image data, 460 x 130, 8-bit/color RGBA, interlaced`

This was also visible in Wireshark (it all depends on which route you want to take).

Finally changing the file extension of `file8.raw` to .PNG gave us the result we were waiting for:
